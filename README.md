User stories:
Team user story (core functionality):
As a student, I want to be matched with a study buddy who is in the same course as me and is available during my study times, so that we can collaborate effectively and keep each other accountable.

Tanaya:
I want to be able to create an account and fill in my info/availability to be matched with others, including my name, bio, courses, program, and availability.

Cooper:
I want to be able to see the profiles of potential matches based on common courses and availability.

Jinbo:
I want to be able to schedule a new study session with my potential study buddy matches.

Alex:
If no matches are found for students taking the same courses I am who are available at times that work with my schedule, or if I don’t want to study with any of my matches, then I want to be given options to expand my search to find other study buddies, such as others in my same program, or simply with others sharing the same availability.

Harris:
Once I have made an account, I want to be able to log into my account and see my upcoming study sessions (when, with who, for what course), if any are booked.
I’d also like to be able to cancel a booked study session if I’m no longer able to attend, or propose a new time to meet.
