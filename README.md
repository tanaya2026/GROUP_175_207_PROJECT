User stories:
Team user story (core functionality):
As a student, I want to be matched with a study buddy who is in the same course as me and is available during my study times, so that we can collaborate effectively and keep each other accountable.

Tanaya:
I want to be able to create an account and fill in my availability and personal information (such as name, courses, bio, etc.) and see a list of potential study buddy matches.

Cooper:
I want to be effectively matched with other students I can study with based on our common availability and shared courses.

Jinbo:
I want to be able to edit my profile/personal details, including name, availability, bio, etc.

Alex:
Of all study buddy matches with common availability, if no matches are found taking my same courses, I want to be able to expand my search to find other study buddies in my same program, even if we arenâ€™t currently taking the same courses.

Harris:
Once I have made an account, I want to be able to log into my account and see my potential study buddy matches. I also want to be able to log out.
